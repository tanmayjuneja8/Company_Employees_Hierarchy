Dear Sir/Madam,

I think hireEmployee/fireEmployee takes more than logn time in my implementation because, the ‘id’ gets inserted in the growable array of array. So we maintain a growable array for every level in the array. So it takes O(n) time for complete insertion/ transfer of children(in case of fireEmployee).

Thank you so much for your time.
Best Regards
Tanmay
