# Company_Employees_Hierarchy

I have implemented a Data Structure which efficiently stores the information of all the employees of a company. 
There are two generic trees implemented for this purpose:- 
One is an AVLTree used for search, insert, delete of employee in the tree. Second is the generic tree (in which one node can have more than one children.) which stores all the employees level-wise.
No Java imports used. Implemented AVL Tree from scratch (Including track of parent node.)
